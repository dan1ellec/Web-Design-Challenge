# Web Design Challenge

## Task

To create a visualisation dashboard website using HTML and CSS based on weather data and visualisations created in a previous assignment. 

In building this dashboard, there will be individual pages for each plot and a means by which the user can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There will also be a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where the user can view the data used to build them.
